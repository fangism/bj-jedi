\chapter{Composition-dependent Strategy}
\label{sec:composition}
\index{composition-dependent}

This chapter examines the variations in strategy that result in
removing one of the simplifications used in Chapter~\ref{sec:basic}.
The underlying principle of a composition-dependent strategy (CDS)
is that the exposed cards affect the distribution of the remaining
cards in the deck.
The number of decks is relevant in determining
the sensitivity of distribution to card exposure, 
so the analyses presented in this chapter 
will be repeated for different numbers of decks.


\section{Composition-dependence Effectiveness}
