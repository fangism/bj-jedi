\chapter{Experimental variations}
\label{sec:exp}

In this chapter, we analyze the possibilities of 
new and experimental variations of BlackJack-like games.  
These are fun to think about what-if

\section{Half-deck Blackjack}
\label{sec:exp:half-deck}

How much additional edge is gained by the player
with only a half deck of cards (standard deck distribution,
(e.g. using only red cards, or only black cards)?

Naturally increased sensitivity to card removal.

Composition-dependent strategy?

\section{Re-double}
\label{sec:exp:redouble}

The player pays the original bet amount for each additional card hit.

The player doubles the existing bet for each additional card hit.

\section{Splitting Non-paired Hands}
\label{sec:exp:split-nonpair}
