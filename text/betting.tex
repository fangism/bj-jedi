\chapter{Betting}
\label{sec:betting}

We have shown how counting enables one to track the swings in
the house edge (or player edge) as cards are seen.
We have also demonstrated how one's action strategy 
can best adapt to changes in the composition of the remaining cards.  
However, no text on Blackjack would be complete without a discussion
on how betting is used to exploit fluctuations in the player's edge.
Intuitively, favorable expectations suggest a larger bet, whereas 
unfavorable expectations suggest betting less or nothing at all.  
A mathematician named J.~R.~Kelly quantified an optimal betting 
strategy based on risk and reward in a 1956 paper~\cite{ref:kelly56}.
