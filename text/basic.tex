\chapter{Basic Strategy}
\label{sec:basic}

This chapter not only reveals the well-known optimal basic strategy
of Blackjack, but it also mathematically derives the strategy 
in great detail.

Assumptions: infinite deck approximation, as if cards drawn are
immediately replaced to eliminate the effects of history.

\section{Surrender}
\label{sec:basic:surrender}

Some blackjack games allow an option to surrender, 
to end the hand by taking back half of the original
bet and giving up half.
There exist situation where the expected outcome of any other action 
is worse than just losing half of the bet outright.  

Early-surrender vs. late-surrender.

\section{Split}
\label{sec:basic:split}

The player is always given the opportunity to split
the initial hand when it consists of equal-valued cards.
Any two 10-valued cards are also splittable.

\subsection{Resplit}
\label{sec:basic:resplit}

\subsection{Split Aces}
\label{sec:basic:split-aces}

Paired Aces are often given exceptional rules in some games.
Some variations limit the resplitting of Aces, 
and another variation allows no further action after
up-cards are dealt on the split aces.
