TODO list:

compute 5-card charlie variations

standard analysis:
	add variance analysis

analyze Blackjack Switch
	when to switch (tables)

BUGS: (run out of cards?)
Dealer plays...
deck_state.cc:120: failed assertion `cards[r]'
Abort

analysis:
impact of using a fixed (basic) strategy in different count situations
	imperfections of strategies

card randomization:
alternatively, std::shuffle entire sequence up front
	this avoids repeated call to RNG,
	but makes it difficult to edit the deck.

simulator/analyzer:
I/O: option to read raw character w/o hitting return (ncurses UI)
logging
track statistics
preset options for rules
save/restore state/accounts
define/use API for hooking up custom strategies
define/use API for hooking up different UIs (stdio, ncurses)

options:
show overall edge given exact count (accumulate)
support different counting schemes besides hi-lo

struct history {
to track every situation and decision?
situations to review? bookmark as a player-choice option
auto-save "wrong" decisions
}

commands:
play-option::TMI: too much information
compare basic vs. dynamic strategy
auto-play-until-count (falls below, based on true-count)

quiz count: after every hand, or at reshuffle time, or periodically

simulation:
add robot players: play styles [perfect, basic, near-perfect, n00b]
option for infinite deck (replace every card)
	almost the same as continuous shuffle

command-line options:
paths to search for config/save/load files?

paper:
write an academic paper on results
	second-order covariant sensitivity analysis
